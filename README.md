# Project Name
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
We have used a basic CNN Model for the assigment for learning purposes

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
	With a small dataset, we should be using Transfer Learning.
	For understanding of concepts, we have used basic CNN structure.
	With basic CNN structure, we see model overfits, if we resolve using augmentation, it underfits
	However, if we fix class imbalance using Augmentor library by adding 1000 variations to each class, we get a good fit model
